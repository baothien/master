This research focuses on developing a system that can retrieve objects from a large image database by exploring the different
types of image features. We propose a global representation of object based on the combination of multiple features. After that, we design a novel method for generic object detecting in still images with automatic feature selection. Our method is simple, computationally efficient 
%and it only bases on features that is easily seen by naked-eye and very close with natural detecting by human.
The main advantage of this method is that it can automatically choose features which are the most suitale for detecting one type of object. We present experimental results for detecting many visual categories including side view car, front view car, bike, motorbike, train, aero plane, horse, sheep, flower and tower. Results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and produces good detection accuracy rate.
